While footprinting is not intended to be damaging (although certain activities, such as network scans, can sometimes cause disruptions to vulnerable applications inadvertently) it may often pave the way for more damaging attacks."], "name": "Footprinting"}], "id": "CVE-2016-4816", "Published": "2016-06-18T21:59:11.043-04:00", "map_cve_scip": {"sciplink": "http://www.scip.ch/en/?vuldb.88050", "scipid": "88050"}, "summary": "BUFFALO WZR-600DHP3 devices with firmware 2.16 and earlier and WZR-S600DHP devices allow remote attackers to discover credentials and other sensitive information via unspecified vectors."}
